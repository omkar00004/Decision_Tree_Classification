The problem is to predict the safety of the car. In this project, I build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the safety of the car. I implement Decision Tree Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn. I have used the Car Evaluation Data Set for this project, downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website.
